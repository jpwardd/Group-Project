DEPRECATION WARNING: Static attributes will be removed in FactoryBot 5.0. Please use dynamic
attributes instead by wrapping the attribute value in a block:

state { "MA" }

To automatically update from static attributes to dynamic ones,
install rubocop-rspec and run:

rubocop \
  --require rubocop-rspec \
  --only FactoryBot/AttributeDefinedStatically \
